# Restaurant-Name-generator
This is an applicaion where user can select the cuisine and based on that the llm will suggest a restaurant name with its list of food items.<br>
Simple Sequencial chain can't able to generate more than one output but in this this project I want to generate both resturant name with its list of menu items ,so I used Sequencial chain which can deal with more than one inputs and outputs.<br>
I used OpenAI Api key for fetching the required content from the llm(Large Language Model) which are getting displayed as an output in the application page.
